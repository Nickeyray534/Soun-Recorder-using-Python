# Soun-Recorder-using-Python
To create voice recorder in Python, the following are the required libraries −
sounddevice − The sounddevice library will be used for capturing audio.
scipy − This library will be used for writing WAV files using write.
wavio − This library will be used for writing wav files with other options.
numpy − This library will be used for matrices or array calculations.
To install the required libraries to create voice records, you need to install these libraries using the PIP. Use the following statement to install all of the required libraries at once − pip install sounddevice scipy wavio numpy
Here is the complete code to create a voice recorder application in Python −
import sounddevice as sd
from scipy.io.wavfile import write
import wavio as wv
import numpy as np
import threading
# Sampling frequency
freq = 44100

# Initialize recording variables
recording = []
is_recording = False
stop_recording = False

def record_audio():
   global recording, is_recording, stop_recording
   is_recording = True
   while is_recording and not stop_recording:
      recording_segment = sd.rec(int(freq), samplerate=freq, channels=2)
      sd.wait()
      recording.append(recording_segment)

def handle_input():
   global is_recording, stop_recording
   while True:
      user_input = input("r to START , p to PAUSE and s to STOP the recording, please choice accordingly \n Enter command: ").lower()
      if user_input == 'p':
         if is_recording:
            print("Recording Paused, (you can again start the recording using 's') ")
            is_recording = False
         else:
            print("Recording is not working activly.")
      elif user_input == 'r':
         if not is_recording:
            print("Recording Resumed (type 'p' to pause or 's' to stop)")
            threading.Thread(target=record_audio).start()
         else:
            print("Already recording.")
      elif user_input == 's':
         if is_recording:
            print("Stopping recording. Thank you for recording :) ")
            is_recording = False
            stop_recording = True
            break
         else:
            print(" Nothing to stop.")

# Start the input handler in a separate thread
input_thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_input)
input_thread.start()

# Wait for the input thread to complete
input_thread.join()

# Combine all the recorded segments
if recording:
   final_recording = np.concatenate(recording, axis=0)
   write("recording0.wav", freq, final_recording)
   wv.write("recording1.wav", final_recording, freq, sampwidth=2)
   print("Recording saved as 'recording0.wav' and 'recording1.wav'.")
else:
   print("No recording was made.")
